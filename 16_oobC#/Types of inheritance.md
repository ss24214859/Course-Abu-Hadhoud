There are the following types of inheritance:

### 1. Single Inheritance

In single inheritance, a single derived class inherits from a single base class.

### 2. Multilevel Inheritance

In multilevel inheritance, a derived class inherits from a base and then the same derived class acts as a base class for another class.

3. Hierarchical Inheritance

In hierarchical inheritance, multiple derived classes inherit from a single base class.

### 4. Multiple Inheritance

In multiple inheritance, a single derived class inherits from multiple base classes. **C# doesn't support multiple inheritance.** However, we can achieve multiple inheritance through interfaces.

### 5. Hybrid Inheritance

Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance. The combination of multilevel and hierarchical inheritance is an example of Hybrid inheritance.

**Types supported by C#**

Note: it does not support hybrid inheritance that contains multiple inheritance.
