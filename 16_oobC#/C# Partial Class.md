There are many situations when you might need to split a class definition, such as when working on a large scale projects, multiple developers and programmers might need to work on the same class at the same time. In this case we can use a feature called **Partial Class**.

## Introduction to Partial Class

While programming in C# (or OOP), we can split the definition of a class over two or more source files. The source files contains a section of the definition of class, and all parts are combined when the application is compiled. For splitting a class definition, we need to use the `partial` keyword.

### Example 1:

Here is file named as MyClass1.cs with the same partial class MyClass which has only the method Method1.
```c#

// File MyClass1.cs
using System;

public partial class MyClass
{
    public void Method1()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Method 1 is called.");
    }
}
```

  

Here is another file named as MyClass2.cs with the same partial class MyClass which has only the method Method2.
```C#

// File MyClass2.cs
using System;

public partial class MyClass
{
    public void Method2()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Method 2 is called.");
    }
}

```
  

Here now we can see the main method of the project:
```C#

// File: Program.cs
using System;


class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        //the code of MyClass is seperated in 2 files class1.cs and class2.cs
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        obj.Method1();
        obj.Method2();

        Console.ReadKey();
        
    }
}

  
```

In this example, the class `MyClass` is split into two files (`MyClass1.cs` and `MyClass2.cs`) using the `partial` keyword. The `Main` method in the `Program.cs` file creates an instance of `MyClass` and calls both `Method1` and `Method2`. Although the class definition is split across multiple files, the compiler will combine the two parts into a single class definition, so the code behaves as if `MyClass` was defined in a single file.  

Places where `partial` class can be used:

1. While working on a larger projects with more than one developer, it helps the developers to work on the same class simultaneously.
2. Codes can be added or modified to the class without re-creating source files which are automatically generated by the IDE (i.e. Visual Studio).

### Things to Remember about Partial Class

The `partial` keyword specify that other parts of the class can be defined in the namespace. It is mandatory to use the partial keyword if we are trying to make a class partial. All the parts of the class should be in the same namespace and available at compile time to form the final type. All the parts must have same access modifier i.e. private, public, or so on.

- If any part is declared abstract, then the whole type is considered abstract.
- If any part is declared sealed, then the whole type is considered sealed.
- If any part declares a base type, then the whole type inherits that class.
- Any class member declared in a partial definition are available to all other parts.
- All parts of a partial class should be in the same namespace.
